    "What is the concept of an abstract superclass in Python? An abstract class can be considered as a blueprint for other classes. It allows you to create a set of methods that must be created within any child classes built from the abstract class. A class which contains one or more abstract methods is called an abstract class\n",
    "\n",
    "Super class being an abstract class creates an overhead for all its sub classes to compulsorily define its abstract methods. I understand that it's very basic but I need to know why do programmers usually make super class as an abstract class, though we can do similar things using a super class as a non abstract class.\n",
    "\n",
    "An abstract superclass is one way to provide re-usable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can extend the abstract class and inherit the code. This is sometimes more convenient than using static methods or object composition to share code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The abstract class can \"fix\" parts of the code (by making it final). This is called the \"template method\" pattern (and this is not possible with an interface, which cannot provide final methods).\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, you can achieve both with a non-abstract superclass as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "An abstract class has the additional benefit that it does not have to provide a complete implementation (that would make sense to instantiate on its own), some parts can be left specified, but unimplemented (the abstract methods)."
