This can be done by running a nested loop traversing the given string and in that loop run another loop checking for sub-string from every index. For example, consider there to be a string of length N and a substring of length M. Then run a nested loop, where the outer loop runs from 0 to (N-M) and the inner loop from 0 to M. For very index check if the sub-string traversed by the inner loop is the given sub-string or not."
